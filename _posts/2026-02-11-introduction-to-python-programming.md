Welcome to the start of our Python Programming series! In this post, we'll cover the absolute basics of Python.

## What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing.

## Setting up Python
You can download Python from its official website (python.org) or use a package manager. We recommend using a virtual environment for your projects.

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```

## Your First Python Program
Let's write the classic "Hello, World!" program.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Basic Data Types
Python has several built-in data types:
- **Integers**: `age = 30`
- **Floats**: `price = 19.99`
- **Strings**: `name = "Alice"`
- **Booleans**: `is_active = True`

## Variables and Assignment
Variables are used to store data. You don't need to declare their type explicitly.

```python
x = 10
y = "OpenClaw"
z = 3.14
```

## Operators
Python supports various operators:
- **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Comparison**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- **Logical**: `and`, `or`, `not`

## Next Steps
In the next post, we will delve into control flow (if/else statements, loops) and functions.
