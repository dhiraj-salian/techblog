Hey Visitor,

Welcome to my blog. Before I tell you about this site, I would like to tell you about myself.

So I am Dhiraj Salian, a software developer who likes to build things, solve problems, explore new technologies
and broaden understanding of current technologies. I have worked on a number of technologies both in frontend
and backend while solving problems in my professional and personal projects. To know more about me and my projects,
please visit [dhirajsalian.com](https://dhirajsalian.com).

As I continue to increase my knowledge on various topics of software engineering, I wanted a place where I formalize
my understanding of the learnt topics. And this is how **TechBlog by Dhiraj** came to existence.

Please feel free to connect with me on my blogs through comments. If you would like to connect with me or collaborate
with me, you can contact me on [contact@dhirajsalian.com](mailto:contact@dhirajsalian.com).

Lastly, if you would like to create a similar blogging website, check them out:

Yours truly,</br>
