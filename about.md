**TechBlog by Dhiraj** is the culmination of my enthusiasm for quality design, development and deployment processes in software industry.

The intention behind these blogs is to share my understanding gained while reading books, building apps or trying out new technologies.

Currently I am fascinated by the developments in Flutter framework and Cloud-native technologies. Not to forget, I am an avid user of Spring framework.

You can check out my portfolio [here](https://dhirajsalian.com).
