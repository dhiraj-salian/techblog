Hey there, curious coder!

Welcome to _TechBlog by Dhiraj_, where we take on everything tech—whether it’s taming the frontend beast, wrestling with backend APIs, dabbling in Machine Learning (ML) models, or even building immersive worlds with Unity. But before you dive into this treasure trove of knowledge, let me tell you a bit about myself.

I'm **Dhiraj Salian**, your friendly neighborhood software developer. My daily routine? Building cool things that (hopefully) work, squashing bugs that pretend they don't exist, and discovering new technologies that keep me up at night. From designing smooth UIs to architecting robust backends, or even experimenting with Generative AI and Machine Learning, I’ve been there, broken that, and fixed it too! If you want to know more about my adventures, swing by [dhirajsalian.com](https://dhirajsalian.com).

So, why this blog? Well, I wanted a space where I could formalize all the tech stuff I've learned and share it with fellow enthusiasts like you. Think of it as a sandbox where we break down complex topics—from **HLD/LLD** (High-level and Low-level Design), **Data Structures & Algorithms**, **AI/ML**, **Deep Learning**, to even getting our hands dirty with **game development using Unity**. This is the stuff that makes tech fun (and a little frustrating, but we love it anyway).

Got something to say? Drop a comment, and let’s geek out together! If you’re more of an email person (or have a cool collaboration idea), feel free to reach out at [contact@dhirajsalian.com](mailto:contact@dhirajsalian.com). I’m always game for tech discussions or even the occasional meme exchange.

And hey, if you're thinking of starting your own tech blog or project, here’s a little starter kit to help:

- **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)** – Because coding in markdown feels like magic.
- **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)** – The perfect place to show off your coding genius for free.
- **[Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)** - A flexible two-column Jekyll theme, perfect for building personal sites, blogs, and portfolios.
- **[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)** – Because your blog deserves some high-quality visuals.
- **[Icons8](https://icons8.com/)** – For icons that bring your blog to life.

Stay curious, keep experimenting, and remember—whether it's frontend, backend, ML, or creating the next big thing in Unity, we’re all learning together. Let’s make this coding journey fun (and a little bit easier) one post at a time.

Yours in code (and many, many Google searches),  
**Dhiraj**
